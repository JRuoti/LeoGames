<h1>Contributions</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<div>
    <p>Everyone in the team was excited by the idea of making a game with <b>multiple playable characters</b>.
        Once we decided that the main characters would be robots, I proposed a <b>post-apocalyptic setting</b> for the novelty of combining <b>machines and nature</b>.</p>

</div>
<h2>Game Design</h2>
<div>
    <p>I wrote game design <b>documents</b> and contributed to the making of a <b>pitch simulation</b>.
        I defined some of the game main mechanics, mainly <b>skills and limitations of individual robots</b>.In fact, limitations were a fundamental pillar of Splitting’s design, due to the challenge of getting around them with the help of the other robot. </p>

</div>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<div>
    <p>I wrote in C# the following scripts: <br>
        <b>Character State Controller</b>, which was directly connected with the animators. For example, it was necessary to check if Ant and Tyr were close enough to combine into TyrAnt.
        <b>Camera Controller</b>, which has proven to be very tricky due to the <b>continuos camera switch</b> between the character.</p>

<h1>What did I learn?</h1>
<p>Carefully evaluate the <b>resources and time available</b>.
    Our first videogame was an overly ambitious project.We finished it too close to the deadline, and we had not very much time to playtest it.
<br>
<br>
Don’t underestimate the <b>control system</b> role, because it can prevent players from experiencing our game to the fullest. We made an intricate control system, where each action was associated with a different input.
