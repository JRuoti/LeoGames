<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>First-person action adventure with puzzle elements made with Unreal Engine 5. <br>
    The main focus of the gameplay is the movement system, which is enhanced by the interaction with magical structures that allow players to modify the environment and express their skill. <br>
    I initially proposed to make a movement-centric game, mainly because I was playing Marvel's Spider-Man and I was excited by the idea of designing a fun motion system</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>I worked to identify the mechanics we needed to create our movement system and how the magical structures were supposed to work. <br>
    Me and the other programmer were responsible for determining the feasibility of our gameplay in realization terms. <br>
    I wrote game design documents on Confluence. <br><br>
    I was the lead level designer for the project, so I was writing documentation and reviewing the levels of my colleagues. <br>
In addition, I got my hands on the engine by making levels from scratch and dressing the scenes. <br>
I was mainly responsible for the character controller, context provider and save system blueprints.
