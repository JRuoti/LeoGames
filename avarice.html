                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>I proposed to make a <b>movement-centric game</b>, mainly because I was playing Marvel's Spider-Man and I was excited by the idea of designing a fun motion system.

                        After some brainstormings we chose to change the parkour formula by <b>not</b> setting our game in <b>a metropolitan context</b>. We also wanted players to be able to <b>change the environment</b>, bu in a controlled way.</b>.

                    <h2>Game Design</h2>
                    <p>I worked to identify the mechanics we needed to create our movement system and how the magical structures were supposed to work in order to modify players experience. <br><br>

                        Me and the other programmer were responsible for determining the feasibility of our gameplay in realization terms. <br>
                        
                        I wrote game design documents on Confluence.

                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p>I wrote documentation and reviewed the levels of my colleagues.
                    I also got my hands on the engine by making levels from scratch and dressing the scenes. <br><br>
                    
                    In addition to that, I wrote the documentation necessary to contextualize tha game elements inside the levels, making them part of the lore.
                    In fact, given the absence of dialogues, we focused on the environmental storytelling.

                    <p>I was mainly responsible for the following systems:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Context Provider</b>, which “read” what surrounds the character in order to <b>trigger the right script</b>. For example, it determines what should be performed when colliding with the wall at a certain angle (wall run or wall climb).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Save System</b>, which I dealt with for the first time in my game developer life.

            <h1>What did I learn?</h1> 
                <p>Work respecting the <b>role’s division</b>. 
                    For this project, we decided to adopt a more <b>professional working method</b> by giving lead positions to some team members. This help a lot in <b>speeding up and improving the quality</b> of the project. <br><br>
                    Become aware of the <b>working pipeline</b>.
                    When more departments are involved, it is crucial to follow the right pipeline. For example, it would have been better for level designers to have more concept arts before starting to work. <br><br>
                    Make by best use of <b>Unreal Engine</b>.
I worked on this project for over a year and I learn a lot about this engine.
The most relevant functions that I want to highlight are the ones that simplify the teamwork, such as level streamings and data tables. <br><br>
<b>Pitch</b> our game to <b>real publishers</b>.
Since our intention was to publish the game, we participated to 2023 First Playable edition, an event for game developers in Florence. There I learn what publishers want to see and hear during a pitch.
