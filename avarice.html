                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>I proposed to make a movement-centric game, mainly because I was playing Marvel's Spider-Man and I was excited by the idea of designing a fun motion system.

                        After some brainstormings we chose to change the parkour formula by not setting our game in a metropolitan context.We also wanted players to be able to change the environment, bu in a controlled way.</b>.

                    <h2>Game Design</h2>
                    <p>I worked to identify the mechanics we needed to create our movement system and how the magical structures were supposed to work in order to modify players experience.
                        Me and the other programmer were responsible for determining the feasibility of our gameplay in realization terms.
                        I wrote game design documents on Confluence.

                    <h2>Programming</h2>
                    <p>I wrote in C# the following scripts:<br>
                        <b>Character State Controller</b>, which was directly connected with the animators. For example, it was necessary to check if Ant and Tyr were close enough to combine into TyrAnt.<br>
                        <b>Camera Controller</b>, which has proven to be very tricky due to the <b>continuous camera switch</b> between the characters.

                <p>Carefully evaluate the <b>resources and time available</b>.
                    Our first videogame was an overly ambitious project. We finished it too close to the deadline, and we had not very much time to playtest it.
                </p>
                <p>Donâ€™t underestimate the <b>control system</b> role, because it can prevent players from experiencing our game to the fullest. We made an intricate control system, where each action was associated with a different input.
